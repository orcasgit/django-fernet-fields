Contributing
============

Thanks for your interest in contributing! The advice below will help you get

.. _issue tracker: https://github.com/orcasgit/django-fernet-fields/issues



Submitting Issues
-----------------

Issues are easier to reproduce/resolve when they have:

- A pull request with a failing test demonstrating the issue
- A code example that produces the issue consistently
- A traceback (when applicable)


Pull Requests
-------------

When creating a pull request:

- Write tests (see below)
- Note user-facing changes in the `CHANGES`_ file
- Update the documentation as needed
- Add yourself to the `AUTHORS`_ file

.. _AUTHORS: AUTHORS.rst
.. _CHANGES: CHANGES.rst


Testing
-------

Please add tests for any changes you submit. The tests should fail before your
code changes, and pass with your changes. Existing tests should not
break. Coverage (see below) should remain at 100% following a full tox run.

To install all the requirements for running the tests::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The tests also require that you have a local PostgreSQL server running and a
user with create-database permissions. The tests will use a database named
``djftest``; if it already exists it will be wiped and re-created.

To run the tests once::

    ./runtests.py

To run tox (which runs the tests across all supported Python and Django
versions) and generate a coverage report in the ``htmlcov/`` directory::

    make test

This requires that you have ``python2.7``, ``python3.5``, ``python3.6``,
``python3.7``, ``pypy``, and ``pypy3`` binaries on your system's shell path.

To install PostgreSQL on Debian-based systems::

    $ sudo apt-get install postgresql

You'll need to run the tests as a user with permission to create databases. By
default, the tests attempt to connect as a user with your shell username. You
can override this by setting the environment variable ``DJF_USERNAME``.
